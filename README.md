## üìã Description

This project is a full-featured hotel management web application designed to streamline hotel operations. It allows administrators to dynamically create, delete, and edit room details, which are immediately reflected on the user interface. Users can effortlessly make reservations through the web app. The project leverages a robust tech stack, including Spring Boot, MySQL, React, Bootstrap, and other cutting-edge technologies.

## üì± Functionalities

* Room Management: Admins can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on rooms. This includes adding new rooms, updating existing room details, and removing rooms from the system. Changes are dynamically reflected on the user interface.

* Reservation System: Users can browse available rooms, make reservations, update their bookings, and cancel reservations through the web app, providing a seamless booking experience.

* User Authentication: The application includes secure user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their reservations.7

* Admin Dashboard: Admins have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage rooms, view current bookings, and oversee overall hotel operations.

* Dynamic Room Availability: The web app dynamically updates room availability based on user reservations, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for users.


## üì∑ Examples

* Dynamic Room Display: The React carousel showcases all available rooms in the hotel. This component dynamically updates whenever new rooms are added, ensuring that users always see the most current offerings.
