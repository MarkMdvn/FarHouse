## üìã Description

This project is a full-featured hotel management web application designed to streamline hotel operations. It allows administrators to dynamically create, delete, and edit room details, which are immediately reflected on the user interface. Users can effortlessly make reservations through the web app. The project leverages a robust tech stack, including Spring Boot, MySQL, React, Bootstrap, and other cutting-edge technologies.

## üì± Functionalities

* Book Management: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on books stored in the database. This includes adding new books, updating existing book information, and removing books from the library.

* Wishlist: Users have the ability to add books to their wishlist, making it convenient to keep track of books they're interested in reading.

## üì∑ Examples

* The 'All Books' page of the project retrieves all book entries from the database dynamically. This process is facilitated by Thymeleaf, which aids in generating dynamic HTML content:

* And this is a screenshot of the relational database from where it fetches the data:

* When you try to add a book, this form will appear and after pressing "Submit", Hibernate will update the database:
